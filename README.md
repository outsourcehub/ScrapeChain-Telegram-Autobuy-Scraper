# Scrape Chain

Open-source, self-hosted Telegram scraper for extracting contract addresses (CAs) from channels/groups and routing them instantly to bots like Blazing. Avoid shared infra delays—control your latency.

**Pitch:** Self-host a scraper to get signals faster without bottlenecks.

## Why a Scraper?

Traders miss entries due to manual copy-paste or crowded scrapers. This automates detection: listens, extracts CAs, forwards reliably. No misses, dedups, or jitter. For users already on Telegram calls + bots who hate being late.

## Features

- **Listening:** Monitors channels/groups for CAs.
- **Extraction:** Instant parse, user filters (any sender).
- **Routing:** Direct to Blazing (<1s exec).
- **Chains:** SOL, BSC, ETH, BASE, ARB, STORY, MONAD, SONIC, AVAX, BERA.
- **Safety:** Honeypot checks, dup prevention.
- **Hosting:** Cloud deploy (24/7, no local PC needed).
- **Community:** Vote on updates; serious users only.

Not a strategy, sniper, or signals—just infra.
